**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goal of this project was to use a neural network to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb). The traffic signs were preprocessed, augmented, normalized, and classified using a deep convolutional neural network (LeNet-5). The model was able to achieve **97.5%** accuracy on the test data.

## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com).

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used numpy to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:

* The size of training set is **34,799**.
* The size of the validation set is **4,410**.
* The size of test set is **12,630**.
* The shape of a traffic sign image is **(32, 32, 3)**. This means that each image is 32 x 32 px and has 3 color channels representing RGB, respectively.
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is **43**. Each image in the dataset belongs to one of these classes.

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

The .csv file (signnames.csv) was loaded using pandas. A table of ClassId and SignName was created and sorted based on number of occurrences. The 'Speed limit (50 km/h)' sign was most prevalent with 2,010 occurrences. The 'Speed limit (20 km/h)', 'Dangerous curve to the left', and 'Go straight or left' signs all occurred only 180 times in the dataset.

A bar chart of the number of occurrences vs. the ClassId was then created. The chart and table show that the dataset is unequally distributed and that synthetic data will need to be added at some point before training takes place.

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

In order for the model to generalize well more data is needed. In addition to creating more samples for training, there are several image augmentation techniques that can used to help increase the accuracy of the model.

Before the images were augmented, additional samples were generated. After some trial and error, it was determined that a total of 5,000 occurrences per class provided the best results. Increasing the number of occurrences from 2,500 to 5,000 increased accuracy on the test set by ~2%. Additional samples equal to the difference between 5,000 and the number of occurrences in the original dataset were added to each class using the [sklearn.resample](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.resample.html). Then each image was processed using the image augmentation pipeline.

Each image was augmented by shifting the brightness, translating horizontally and vertically, and rotating. The magnitude of each augmentation was determined randomly for each image.

Finally, all images were converted to grayscale and normalized. Based on Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun's [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) that was included with the iPython notebook, using color channels did not meaningfully improve the accuracy of the model. So, in this case, only the Y channel of the YCbCr color space is used.

####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

I used the LeNet-5 model provided to us in the classroom. The layers and their descriptions are shown in the table below.

| Layer         		|     Description	        					|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| Input         		| 32x32x1 YCbCr image   							|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x32 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x32 				|
| Dropout	    | 0.5      									|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x64 				|
| Dropout	    | 0.5      									|
| Fully connected		| outputs 7872        									|
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout	    | 0.5      									|
| Fully connected		| outputs 1024        									|
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout	    | 0.5      									|
| Fully connected		| outputs 43        									|
| Softmax				|       									|

####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

The hyperparameters used for this model are shown in the table below.

| Hyperparameter         		|     Description	        					|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| Batch Size         		| 256   							|
| Epochs     	| 50 	|
| Learning Rate					|	1e-3											|
| L2 Regularization Lambda	      	| 1e-5 				|
| Dropout	    | 0.5      									|

The Adam optimizer was used.

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
- training set accuracy of **1.000**
- validation set accuracy of **0.985**
- test set accuracy of **0.975**

As I mentioned above, the LeNet-5 architecture was used for this project. There were several reasons: the model is not overly complicated which allows it run *reasonably* quickly on my laptop, LeNet has been shown to work well with classification problems, and LeNet is a proven model that didn't require significant modification. This project did not require a state-of-the-art architecture in order to pass the required test accuracy and as it is, the LeNet architecture performed better than I would have expected.

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

The five additional German traffic signs are shown below.

![Bumpy road][image4] ![Pedestrian crossing][image5] ![Traffic signals][image6]
![Speed limit (60 km/h)][image7] ![No overtaking][image8]

The five additional signs shoud not be difficult to classify. To increase the difficulty, real images that included signs could have been used. In that case, more preprocessing to isolate the signs would be required.

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| Bumpy Road      		| Bumpy Road   									|
| Pedestrian Crossing     			| Pedestrian Crossing 										|
| Traffic Signals Ahead					| Traffic Signals Ahead											|
| Speed Limit (60 km/h)	      		| Speed Limit (60 km/h)				 				|
| No Overtaking			| No Overtaking     							|

The neural network correctly classified the new signs 5 out of 5 times. This compares favorably to the accuracy of the test set. A larger set of new signs would need to be classified in order to determine the true accuracy of the network on unseen images.

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The model correctly classified each image with 99-100% certainty in each case. This is due to the quality of the new signs.

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| 1.00000      		| Bumpy Road   									|
| 0.99977     			| Pedestrian Crossing 										|
| 0.99998					| Traffic Signals Ahead											|
| 0.99934	      		| Speed Limit (60 km/h)				 				|
| 0.99969			| No Overtaking     							|

Since the probabilities for each prediction are so high, the probability of the model classifying the signs as something else was less than at most 0.000225 in each case.
